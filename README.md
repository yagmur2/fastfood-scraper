# fastfood-scraper
Web scraper component for a larger iOS application project. Pulls HTML tagged data from https://fastfoodnutrition.org/fast-food-restaurants and stores parsed data in JSON format. This is my first real attempt at both building a web scraper and using Python 3.8. Uses Python's Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries.
